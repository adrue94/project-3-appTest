                    Group repository for : Aldo Lee, Amanda Pham, Michael Cummings & Rupal Shah

## Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.


## Project Details :
	We have data that shows U.S. births by geography, gender and educational level across a 5 year span. The base CSV file has over 5000 entries, which may be trimmed to highlight differences between different subjects / states. The database further tracks birth before and after CoVID which may reveal its relationships on population births across various states.. 


## Data and Delivery:

Data components used in the project are clearly documented.
The dataset contains at least 100 unique records. 
A database is used to house the data (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
The project is powered by a Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and the chosen database.

## Back End 
The page created to showcase data visualizations runs without error.
A JavaScript library not shown in class is used in the project.
The project conforms to the following designs :
A dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data

## Visualizations 
A minimum of three unique views present the data.
Multiple user-driven interactions (such as dropdowns, filters, or a zoom feature) are included on the final page. 
The final page displays visualizations in a clear, digestible manner. 
The data story is easy to interpret for users of all levels.
